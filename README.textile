h1. Hon-ee Pot Captcha

I wanted to try to use the honey pot captcha technique to combat spam on my site. This technique includes a field on each form, hides it off the page with CSS and then validates on the back end to make sure it's not filled in.

This addon validates Freeform forms and the EE comment form.

h2. Requirements & Installation

Hon-ee Pot Captcha is built to run on EE 2.0. To install:

* Copy honeepot into your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.
* Go to Add-ons -> Extensions and "Enable extension."
* You can customize the field name for the honey pot field and the message a user receives if the field is filled in by going to the extension settings.
